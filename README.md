we develop a classification system to distinguish between queen bees and worker bees using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the VGG architecture. The system leverages a labelled dataset of bee
images, applying image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance. We train
a CNN model based on the VGG network, known for its deep layers and strong feature extraction capabilities.
This project highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in species identification tasks.
